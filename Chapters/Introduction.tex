\section{Introduction} \label{sec:Introduction}
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital cryptocurrency created by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. The first paper on Bitcoin \cite{Nakamoto_Bitcoin}, also referred to as the original Bitcoin paper, was published by Nakamoto in 2008. It provides a brief description of the concepts and architecture schematics of the Bitcoin protocol. It was used as theoretical groundwork for the first implementation of a fully functional Bitcoin client. However, up until now, no structured and accessible protocol specification has been written. Although the Bitcoin community has successfully created a protocol specification \cite{Wikipedia_ProtocolSpec}, it requires solid prior understanding of its concepts and implementation. In this paper a formal and accessible specification of the core Bitcoin protocol, i.e. excluding the P2P overlay network, will be presented.
